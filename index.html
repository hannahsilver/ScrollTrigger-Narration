            <p>My name is Rachael Popowich, I am a free will astrologer based out of Montreal. My style and
              service is aimed at using natal astrology as a psychosocial tool. </p>  
          </div>

          <div id="slide-2" class="slide">
            <p>Often, when grappling with a personal crisis clinical language is helpful. But what if
              descriptions of that nature don’t speak to us deeply enough? The astrological alphabet of
              shapes and symbols, when interpreted thoughtfully and with care can offer an antidote to
              simple reductions of personality.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="slide-3" class="slide">
              <p>Isn’t there a more mysterious and soulful vocabulary that can
                mirror the mysterious and soulful complexity of your experience? </p>
              </div>
              

              <div id="slide-4" class="slide"> 
              <p>Astrology is a strange language that has the capacity to do that. That strangeness is its power. </p>

              <div id="slide-5" class="slide">                
                <p>Clock time can delineate a minute, but astrology can delineate the quality of a moment. Often
                  we engage with the concept of time by observing the effects of it, astrological language is
                  interested in the quality of it as well. What a refreshment for the soul, to be able to
                  occasionally converse intimately about the occult operations of ourselves. </p>

                <p>I see my natal chart readings as a “You Are Here” arrow on the map of meaning. Making sense
                  of where you are, where you come from, and where you are going. It is immensely powerful to
                  gain insight into the narrative arch of one’s life. The intention of my service is to do exactly
                  that. </p>

                  my practice, please ask your questions via the contact email provided. It would be my pleasure
                  and privilege to work with you. </p>
